- Eliminates the need for server-side session storage and ensures data integrity and authenticity.

ðŸ”’ **Keycloak**
- Integrates Keycloak for seamless identity and access management, providing SSO (Single Sign-On) capabilities.
- Offers centralized authentication, user federation, and social login support, enhancing the user authentication experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Security**
- **OAuth2**

   - Start the Keycloak server and create a new realm, client, and users as needed.
   - Configure Keycloak settings in your Spring Boot application.

3. **Configure application properties**:
   Update `application.properties` or `application.yml` with your database, Keycloak, and other necessary configurations.

   ```properties
   # application.properties
   keycloak.realm=your-realm
   keycloak.resource=your-client
   keycloak.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8080/auth
   keycloak.credentials.secret=your-client-secret
   keycloak.ssl-required=external
   keycloak.bearer-only=true


4. **Build the project**:
    ```bash 
      mvn clean install

5. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
      mvn spring-boot:run


## Usage
